The Synthesis library is intended initially to provide an interface to
the AD9835 Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) IC, with an eye towards eventually
incorporating other methods of synthesis. This could mean interfaces to the
rest of the Analog Devices DDS family, or perhaps even to SCPI-enabled
signal generators.

For those who are not aware, the AD9835 is a 50MS/s sinusoidal DDS.  While
it does not have the fancy multichip synchronisation and PLL functionality
of some of the more upmarket devices that Analog Devices produce, it provides
a quick and easy way to produce a stable sinusoid with a frequency that
can be accurately tuned in software.
